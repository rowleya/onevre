        <h1>Configuring <em>My Venues</em> </h1>
        <hr width="100%" color="black"/>
		<p>When you want to configure the "My Venues" options using the 
		"My Venues" configuration button&nbsp;(<img class="button" 
		src="/pag/images/myvenues.png" alt="configure My Venues" />),
		the PAG user interface will be disabled until the configuration is finished.
		To show this a semi-transparent "curtain" is drawn.</p>
		<img src="images/pag-myVenues_small.png" alt="PAG My Venues configuration" />
		<p>The dialogue provides a list containing previously selected Venues:</p>
		<img src="images/pag-myVenues_content.png" alt="PAG My Venues options" />
		<p>Selecting a list item fills the Input fields for Name and URL which 
		can be altered and resubmitted using "Change" or deleted using "Remove".
		"OK" leaves the dialogue.</p>  
		<p>To Add a Venue to "My Venues" you can simply click on the 
		"Add&nbsp;to&nbsp;My&nbsp;Venues&nbsp;..." link in the Venue Monitoring 
		Part of the PAG user interface while you are in the Venue.</p>
		<p> Clicking on this link while you're not in a venue opens a Dialogue 
		that allows to add a Venue:</p>
		<img src="images/pag-myVenues_add.png" alt="PAG My Venues add venue" />
		<p> Here you can provide a "human readable" name and the URL of the 
		Venue you want to add.</p>
