		<p>The JabberClient is an interface to a text chat tool where the node operators can exchange information. 
		In a normal room configuration this chat window is usually not seen by the meeting participants. 
		The Jabber text chat is just an additional communication media which can be helpful if the audio or video 
		communication is disrupted.</p>
		<p>The Jabber text chat is a group chat. When you connect to a venue you automatically join the chat that 
		is connected to the venue. You will receive all the messages that have been sent through the venue including
		 your own. There are also some status messages sent throught the jabber interface. These messages start with
		  "***" and include updates on people joining and leaving the venue and other venue spcific information. </p>
