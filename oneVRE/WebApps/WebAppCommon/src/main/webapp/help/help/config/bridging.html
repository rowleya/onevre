        <h1>Multicast / Unicast Configuration</h1>
        <hr width="100%" color="black"/>
		<p>When you want to configure the Networking options using the 
		Multicast&nbsp;/&nbsp;Unicast configuration button&nbsp;(<img class="button" 
		src="/pag/images/network.png" alt="Multicast / Unicast configuration" />),
		the PAG user interface will be disabled until the configuration is finished.
		To show this a semi-transparent "curtain" is drawn.</p>

		<p>The Network configuration is usually set up to automatically configure 
		the bridging.</p> 
		<img src="images/pag-bridge_content.png" alt="PAG multicast options" />
		<p>To change the configuration you can select:</p>
		<dl>
		<dt>Automatic Configuration</dt>
		<dd>In this setting PAG determines your networking capabilities by 
		contacting the Point of Reference Server (a server that reliably 
		responds to network requests, i.e. ping). It first tries to use 
		multicasting to send packages to the other AG clients. If the built in 
		Point of Reference Client does not get a response (in time) it changes 
		to unicast and tries to find a suitable bridge in the Bridge registry.
		It successively checks trough the list and switches to a "good" bridge.
		</dd>
		<dt>Multicast</dt>
		<dd>This setting disables the automatic Bridge switching and sets PAG 
		to use Multicasting. Only use this if you know that your network has 
		Multicasting relieably enabled.</dd>
		<dt>Unicast</dt>
		<dd>This setting disables the automatic Bridge switching and sets PAG 
		to use a unicast bridge of your choice to be selected from the given 
		Bridge registries. Use this if you know a reliable 
		bridge at (or near) your site and assume multicast not to work.</dd>
		</dl>
		<h3>Point of Reference</h3>
		The Point of Reference is a server that reliably responds to network
		requests, i.e. ping. Each PAG server comes by default with its own Point
		of Reference server that you should be able to contact. This server 
		should be set up by the local administrator of the PAG server.
		<h3>Bridge Registries</h3> 
		The Bridge Registry provides a list of Bridges available to be used by
		Access Grid sessions. The default should be set by the local 
		administrator of the PAG server.
