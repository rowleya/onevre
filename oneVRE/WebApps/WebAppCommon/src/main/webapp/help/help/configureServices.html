        <h1>Configuring Services</h1>
        <hr width="100%" color="black"/>

        <p>By default, PAG will setup services for audio transmission and
           reception (AudioService), video reception (VideoService), and video
           transmission (VideoProducerService) for each video device it detects
           on your computer.  If you do not choose to overwrite the default
           configuration, the video devices will be detected and updated on each
           run of PAG i.e. there is no need to configure services to add or
           remove a video device.</p>

        <p>You may still choose to change the defaults or to add additional
           profiles.  This can be done via the <a href="config/nodeService">Service Configuration dialogue</a>.
           This dialog can also be used to set up a multi-machine node, where
           the services are run on distributed machines to reduce the load on
           any one machine.</p>
