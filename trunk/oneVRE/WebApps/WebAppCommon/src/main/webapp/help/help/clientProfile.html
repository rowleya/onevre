        <h1>Client Profile</h1>
        <hr width="100%" color="black"/>

        <p>The client profile dialog allows you to change your Access Grid
           identity.  Remote users will be able to see the fields that you fill
           in.  Your <b>name</b> and your <b>e-mail address</b> are required.
           The remaining items are optional.</p>

        <p>Your <b>home venue</b> is the venue that will be displayed each time
           you return to the PAG portlet.</p>

        <p>The <b>type</b> of your profile determines what icon is used to
           display your profile within the client.  This is purely
           informational; neither type has any different properties.  You can
           select between:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>User - this implies that you have a personal node which will
                support only one user at a time (e.g. a laptop with a headset and
                camera).</li>
            <li>Node - this implies that you have a node in which multiple users
                can use the Access Grid at the same time.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Once you have entered the details, select the <b>Store Profile</b>
           button.  Your details will then be stored for future sessions (see
           below).</p>

        <h3>Cookies and Portlet User Information</h3>
        <p>PAG can be run in two modes; in <b>Authenticated Mode</b>, PAG will
           store your client profile information within the portlet data storage
           system.  In <b>Unauthenticated Mode</b>, PAG will store your client
           profile information using a cookie.  In order for PAG to successfully
           retrieve this information each time it is run, cookies must be
           enabled and your browser must keep the cookie when it is restarted.
           Both these options should be configurable within your browser; most
           are configured in this way by default.</p>
