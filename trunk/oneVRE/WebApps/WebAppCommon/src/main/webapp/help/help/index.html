        <p>Portal Access Grid (PAG) is an
           <a target="_blank" href="http://www.accessgrid.org/">Access Grid</a>
           Toolkit client designed to work within a web browser.</p>

			<p>
			The Portlet Access Grid project provides a fully-functional portlet
			client for the Access Grid Toolkit version 3 (AGTkv3) that in addition
			enables automatic and transparent switching to unicast when multicast
			becomes unavailable, allows the use of Access Grid behind restrictive
			firewalls and from low bandwidth connections, and significantly
			simplifies the installation procedure for users as it only requires a
			recent Java Runtime Environment (1.5 or newer) on the client machine.
			</p>
			
			<p>The portlet client can connect to any AGTk3 server and allows free
			navigation of virtual venues, communication using audio and video,
			access to the Jabber text chat, and access to shared applications and
			data within the venue. This client will be fully interoperable with
			other AGTk3 users and be designed to be easy to incorporate AGTk
			updates, as well as retaining the current level of AGTk interoperability
			with ioCom clients. These developments have the potential to benefit the
			significant portion of the academic community currently using Access
			Grid, will allow use of Access Grid within a familiar web-based
			environment from almost any location, e.g. internet cafes/hotel rooms,
			and will address the major perceived drawbacks to Access Grid compared
			to other collaboration environments.</p>
			
			<h3>Running PAG</h3>

			<p>PAG can be run in two modes; in Authenticated Mode, PAG will store your
			client profile information within the portlet data storage system. In
			Unauthenticated Mode, PAG will store your client profile information
			using a cookie. In order for PAG to successfully retrieve this
			information each time it is run, cookies must be enabled and your
			browser must keep the cookie when it is restarted. Both these options
			should be configurable within your browser; most are configured in this
			way by default.</p>
